# Predicting Why a Pro Valorant eSports Team Wins

This project used competitive Valorant data to determine if a competitive team would win based on a selection of features. This dataset came from nearly 15,000 completed matches and a mix of professional and amateur teams.

## About Valorant
Valorant is a 5v5 character-based, tactical FPS shooter game developed by Riot Games and released in 2021. Teams take turns being on either attack or defend, spending 12 rounds on each. The first team to win 13 round is the winner. If both teams are at 12, then an overtime occurs with teams getting a set economy each round, they alternate sides after every round, and a team has to win by 2 rounds to win the match in overtime.

## Data:

The data originally came from a Kaggle search where I ended on this [page]([https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-asset-kit/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/visualize25/valorant-pro-matches-full-data)). A CSV file of the data can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgfbORLFSODzyC5OGp0BWGWJ8VD7Vcx9DkjxBdnSgzfjxJmqAXlk-iyb8e6io3dYkjUCWtZuteOIZY/pub?output=csv).
