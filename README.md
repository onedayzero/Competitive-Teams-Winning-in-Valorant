# Predicting Why a Pro Valorant eSports Team Wins

This project used competitive Valorant data to determine if a competitive team would win based on a selection of features. This dataset came from nearly 15,000 completed matches and a mix of professional and amateur teams.

## Data:

The data originally came from a Kaggle search where I ended on this [page]([https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-asset-kit/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/visualize25/valorant-pro-matches-full-data)). A CSV file of the data can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgfbORLFSODzyC5OGp0BWGWJ8VD7Vcx9DkjxBdnSgzfjxJmqAXlk-iyb8e6io3dYkjUCWtZuteOIZY/pub?output=csv).
